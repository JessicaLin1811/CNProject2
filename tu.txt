The University of Tulsa is celebrating its rise among American research universities in the 2016 U.S. News & World Report rankings released Wednesday.

TU is ranked No. 86 among national universities and is a Top 50 private university, according to the publication, which evaluates doctoral degree-granting institutions based on several key factors including peer assessment, high school counselor assessment and class sizes.

For 13 years, TU has been a Top 100 national university and remains the highest ranked college in the state. The University of Tulsa is home to more nationally competitive scholars than all other Oklahoma colleges combined and is the highest ranked for global collaboration in the state with international students making up about a quarter of the student body.

“TU continues to improve on key metrics such as graduation rate and selectivity. Beyond the U.S. News numbers, we have set goals internally to increase student and faculty diversity, support prestigious research projects and improve the Tulsa community through our new College of Health Sciences,” university President Steadman Upham said.

This year, TU created an Office of Diversity and Engagement to advance diversity campuswide. The university also welcomed its first class of students to the Health Sciences college and furthered its research opportunities with important partners such as NASA and the Laureate Institute for Brain Research. TU also opened another new building on campus this fall: Hardesty Hall, which houses Holmes Student Center and a 308-bed all-suites residence hall.

In its 2016 report, U.S. News examined 280 national universities, a classification developed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. TU’s commitment to small class sizes continues, as just 3 percent of classes contain 50 or more students. Only six top 100 doctoral universities reported a lower percentage in this category.
